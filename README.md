# Background Resource Processing
A mod for Kerbal Space Program that simulates resources on your ships while they
are unloaded.

Unlike stock KSP, it will simulate:
- Resource conversion chains with multiple steps. Want to drill ore from an
  asteroid, convert it to LF+Ox, power the whole thing off a fuel cell array,
  and then go do something else for a while? It'll just work!
- Day/Night differences in solar power. You can no longer preserve power by
  just looking away when your ship is in the dark. (Note that this is not
  implemented yet).

## Install
This mod is currently at a very early stage. You will need to build it yourself.
See the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a description
of how to do this.

## Documentation
Coming soon! (I hope)
