# Features
The goal of this mod is to accurately simulate resources on ships in the
background no matter how complicated those ships are or how fast you timewarp.
It adds no new parts and really has no UI you need to learn. Just add it to
your save and observe that your resource conversion chains now work properly
in the background.

If you are a modder and want to either add support to your own mod or use
BRP directly within your mod, then see [the wiki][wiki].
